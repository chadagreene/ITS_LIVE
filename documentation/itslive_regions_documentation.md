# `itslive_regions` documentation
The `itslive_regions` function displays a world map with ITS\_LIVE mosaic regions labeled. 

## Syntax

```matlab
itslive_regions
h = itslive_regions 
```

## Description 

`itslive_regions` displays a map of ITS\_LIVE regions. 

`h = itslive_regions` also returns a handle `h` of the plotted object. 

## Example
Here's how to show the ITS\_LIVE regions in MATLAB: 

```matlab
itslive_regions
```

In the image above, each colored rectangle represents an ITS\_LIVE mosaic region. For example, RGI01A corresponds to Region 1 in the syntax of the MATLAB functions in this repository. 

Some 100 km by 100 km black squares fall outside the ITS\_LIVE mosaic regions. In those locations, the full record of velocity data are available in Zarr and NetCDF format as Level 2 image-pair data, but are not provided as mosaicked data.
